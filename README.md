# Weather Dashboard
## Get your weather and 5 day forecast at the click of a button! 

This weather dashboard was created to help you search for the weather in your favorite cities quickly and easily! It will also save your past searches so you don't have to remember yourself! 

### Usage

Please visit my [Site!](https://tayskully.github.io/weather-dashboard/)
In order to get the full experience, users must enter in the city of their choice in the home country's language. If the user types in an invalid city, the site will request they enter a valid city name. Once the user enters a valid city, they will see the weather for the day, as well as the forecast for the next 5 days. If they want to search again, just enter in the next city of their choice. If you want to go back to a previous city, just click one of the past search buttons to check that forecast again. 

The interaction may look like the following screenshots:
